        We are the Youth Red Cross Club at J.C. Bose University of Science and Technology — where compassion meets action.

United by the spirit of service, we are a vibrant student community committed to healing, protecting, and uplifting lives.

From blood donation drives and first-aid workshops to mental health campaigns, we lead with purpose. We proudly celebrate World Red Cross Day each year, honoring a legacy of kindness and resilience.

Our reach extends beyond campus through strong ties with affiliated colleges, uniting hundreds in service to society.
<p>Join the movement — young, united, and unstoppable.
